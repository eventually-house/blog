    <section class="post-content">
      <p>In the summer of 2019 my fiancé and I purchased a home in Belmont, California that was originally built in 1946. Our house is in need of a lot of work - the property is not livable in its current state and this blog is our effort to document what will surely be an extensive renovation process, along with navigating and learning about the various big choices we will have to make along the way.</p>
<p>First, a bit about the property: the seller was an estate trustee so we essentially bought the place knowing very little about it. This was a gamble as we didn’t really know what we were getting into: how much was going to be reusable? What unknown, lurking problems might we find in the walls? We didn’t know. For anyone not familiar with the housing market in the SF bay area, property moves so quickly that contingent offers are infrequent and everyone is largely jumping into home purchases feet first. It’s just the way that it is, for better or for worse. Despite this, we loved the area; Belmont has an actual community - a rarity in modern society - and people want to get to know each other; our new neighbors are delightful and moved into their respective houses broadly before we were even born! People love this small city and often don’t leave once they move here - that speaks volumes to us and was something we wanted to be a part of. The area is quiet, neighborhood kids play in the road - it’s somewhere we could see ourselves building a family.</p>
<p>The property itself is set on a 13,000 sq/ft “up-slope” lot that increases in grade as you move from north to south. This setting fills that rear yard with sunshine! The existing house was constructed in 1946 and stands at around 1900 sq/ft livable space. Best we can tell the house has had several additions over the years and we think there have been two additions to convert what was most likely, a classic L-shaped 1-story post-war rancher into a 1-story family home typical of the area.</p>
<p>In addition to the house, there is a detached garage of roughly 700 sq/ft that is full of old cabinetry that will have to be removed. The structure appears to be in fairly good shape - that will need to be validated by an engineer of course - but we are thinking that the garage will be more of a facelift than a total reconstruction, as a new roof is needed and there are things we will have to do in order to bring the building up to code, but it seems unlikely that we will completely demolish the garage to be mindful of costs.</p>
<p>The wider land on the property is brimming with trees and vegetation - we have 5 live oaks, 3 redwoods, 3 lemon trees, a pear tree, an original red delicious apple tree and a massive deodar cedar - its by far one of the best things about the place, although the yard can’t have been maintained much in the last decade so it’s more jungle than garden. Since buying the property we have been frequently working on the land to try and restore the health of some of the bigger trees that were either drought stricken or suffering beetle infestation / fungal issues. The lemon trees produce so many lemons it’s been hard knowing what to do with them all! So far we’ve given them away to our neighbors and sometimes make batches of lemonade.</p>
<p>Ideally at the end of this process, we will be able to move into a modern, well crafted home that fits its surroundings and is highly energy efficient. The property is well suited to a solar installation, and as being “solar ready” is now part of the California building code (since 2019) whatever we come up with will have to support solar, this is a must. Ideally we would have a 4 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom arrangement, but we will see what falls out in the design and engineering phases later down the line.</p>
<p>We estimate that the project design will take around 6 months, and consutrction will take around a year. Which should complete the project in roughly a 2-year time horizon, start to finish.</p>
