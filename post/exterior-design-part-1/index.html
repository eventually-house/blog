      <p>When we first started looking for homes for sale that could become our family home for the long haul, we were dumbfounded by the market: both prices and lack of choice - we had absolutely no intention of undertaking a massive construction project like this. After countless home viewing trips with our realtor (who was great throughout the whole buying process), we started to look at homes outside our price range and it quickly became clear that even if we stretched ourselves financially, we still wouldn&rsquo;t get the kind of home we wanted. This presented a significant problem.</p>
<p>We decided the next logical step was to build if you can&rsquo;t buy; this seemingly simple change of direction presented yet more questions, but most strikingly &ldquo;what do you want?&quot;. This is seemingly simple question, but when it comes down to it, so few people in life have the clarity of mind to know decisively what they want - especially when they are playing with what is for many, the largest purchase they will ever make. After the need to build our future had set-in, we started looking at different styles of home - there are an overwhelming number of options. Thus far, there are a few qualities of design that we really like; below are some inspirations (with credits where known) and some thoughts:</p>

<p>What I really like about this is the low-rise nature of the building. It sprawls across the scene but in a manner that doesn&rsquo;t feel busy. The almost wall-to-wall glass is quite wonderful and likely fills the internal spaces will light. Our project will be no where near as big as this, so the comparison is not really valid. If we could capture the elegance of this house, I would end up really happy.</p>

<p>This property is all about the cladding and the view; it&rsquo;s very like Sea Ranch, CA - I absolutely love these wooden materials. This property actually caused me to wander off down a proverbial rabbit hole looking at modern wood cladding materials, and it turns out that both <a href="https://accoya.com">Accoya</a> and <a href="https://kebony.com/en">Kebony</a> both manufacture kinds of woods from FSC-certified softwood forests that are artificially augmented, such that the product resists rot and distortion to the same degree that that a tier-1 tropical hardwood does, which is frankly staggering. This also means that slow-growth hardwood doesn&rsquo;t have to be used (e.g Ipe), which makes for a sustainable sourcing and manufacturing chain. Design-wise, the vertical wood cladding with the black of the window detailing looks fantastic - it&rsquo;s clever how the drainage has been integrated into the facade of the house with the parapet roof, such that it mirrors the central massing - that small detail adds a semblance of design balance.</p>

<p>This property is easily one of my favorites from online searching. In life, whenever you see something that looks effortless, you can be sure that a lot of hard work went into making said thing appear that way - being effortless is anything but! I really like how they have captured a mid-century modern vibe whilst keeping the detailing modern, but discrete - metal flashing on the box windows, boarded concrete for the walls and fireplace; its magnificent.</p>
