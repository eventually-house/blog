      <description>In the summer of 2019 my fianc√© and I purchased a home in Belmont, California that was originally built in the 1940s. Our house is in need of a lot of work - the property is not livable in its current state and this blog is our effort to document what will surely be an extensive renovation process, along with navigating and learning about the various big choices we will have to make along the way.</description>
