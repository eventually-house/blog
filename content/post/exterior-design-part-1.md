When we first started looking for homes for sale that could become our family home for the long haul, we were dumbfounded by the market: both prices and lack of choice - we had absolutely no intention of undertaking a massive construction project like this. After countless home viewing trips with our realtor (who was great throughout the whole buying process), we started to look at homes outside our price range and it quickly became clear that even if we stretched ourselves financially, we still wouldn't get the kind of home we wanted. This presented a significant problem. 

We decided the next logical step was to build if you can't buy; this seemingly simple change of direction presented yet more questions, but most strikingly "what do you want?". This is seemingly simple question, but when it comes down to it, so few people in life have the clarity of mind to know decisively what they want - especially when they are playing with what is for many, the largest purchase they will ever make. After the need to build our future had set-in, we started looking at different styles of home - there are an overwhelming number of options. Thus far, there are a few qualities of design that we really like; below are some inspirations (with credits where known) and some thoughts:

What I really like about this is the low-rise nature of the building. It sprawls across the scene but in a manner that doesn't feel busy. The almost wall-to-wall glass is quite wonderful and likely fills the internal spaces will light.
