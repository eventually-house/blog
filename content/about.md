_eventually.house_ is a journal of the design and build process for a modern energy efficient home in the San Francisco Bay Area. This project started in fall 2019 and the owners are attempting to document the entire process, start to finish. The name comes from disucssions that we were having during the early stages of the project, where seemingly everything we spent our time on was future-looking, always waiting; hence, the project became our "eventually house".

We started this blog as there was little information available that told a story end-to-end on such a large project. What can we expect? How should we think about the various challenges associated with domains they we are unfamiliar with? Our intention is to document objectively and share our experiences such that they might be useful for other people who want to embark on their own construction journey.

Best wishes,
